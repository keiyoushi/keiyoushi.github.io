## Additional setup
### Trouble finding a specific series?
If you encounter difficulties while searching for a specific series, consider:

- Look up the manga on [Google](https://google.com) or a manga database such as [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/).

- Double-check your spelling and try again, as some sources might use **Japanese romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > Example: **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.

- Some sources may use different spellings or wordings for titles.
  > Example: **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**

  > Example: **3-gatsu no Lion** instead of **Sangatsu no Lion**.

- If you still cannot find the series, try searching for a website's extension you've found in
step 1 in the [extensions](/extensions/) list.
